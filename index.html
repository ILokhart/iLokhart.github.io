            <p>I enjoy reading technical manuals, taking short walks to the mailbox, and maintaining my beard. I have been married for seven years but I don't remember getting married.
            I enjoy working with machines that look like people and people that work like machines. My friends and family only speak to me when they need something fixed, but I have a nice mecanical keyboard.
            So I have that going for me... which is nice. Once you go clack, you never go back.</p>
